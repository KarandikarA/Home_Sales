# Home_Sales
Module 22 Challenge 

### Purpose 
This challenge was using PySparkSQL to learn about different metrics on home sales. Using SparkSql, the program was supposed to extract things from the dataset. 

The challenge used home_sales_revised.csv for its data 

### SparkSQL Analysis 

Using SparkSQL, the notebook looked at 
 - calculating average prices for houses based on different dimensions (how many bedrooms, bathrooms, when it was built )
 - comparing performance of cached vs. uncached data 
 - Analyzing the parquet formatted data 

 ### References 

For this project, I used ChatGPT when I had trouble with performing the average price segments and used the module challenge instructions.
